## General Info
The app allows for the suer to search current weather and conditions as well as forecast for the following four days by city. It already has three cities stored, and will add any new cities the user adds during each session.

## Functionality
The weather app uses API calls to [Open Weather](https://api.openweathermap.org) to GET current and forecasted weather.
